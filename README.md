Udacity - Data Science Blog Post - Project

Project Introduction:

from project requirements
The project is to select any publically available data set, understand the data and the domain, then answer 3-6 different question related to the data set.   
I choose airbnb - Boston dataset, which is available on Kaggle, which AirBnB has made public of its rental properties in and around Boston, MA neighborhoods, along with the reviews left by the guests and the dates when properties were available. In this blog we review this data to learn about the neighborhood and attempts to understand what types of properties are available, their prices, concentration of these listing, number of reviews and lastly how guests described the properties after their stay.

# Libraries used  
matplotlib - to plot the visuals    
seaborn (v 0.11.2) - to plot the visuals   
pandas 0.23.3  - for data manipulation   
numpy 1.19.5  - for data manipulation  
sklearn 0.24.2,  - for text processing  
python 3.6.3  -  developing language  
nltk  - Text processing  
wordcloud  - presenting the influential words as a visual of words cloud   

# Datasets
Data sets are copied in the data folder. Unzip and copy these in the data folder. The notebook was created in kaggle and has kaggle specific file location

## Property listing:   
Contains the detail about the property, captured under 95 different attributes. It describes property in terms of its location, availability, price, amenities, details about host and many others. Here is complete list of attributes (columns) available in the listing data

# Conclusion  
Apartments are the most common property type, with over 70% of all rental property types. Over 60% of listings have offered the entire home or apartment for rent. Interestingly, we also find boats, dorms, villas, and camper/RVâs listed as rental properties. We also find that the downtown or urban areas have overwhelmingly more apartment listings in comparison to suburbs where homeowners rented out private rooms.  

Half of the neighborhoods have listed over 80% of the available rental properties on Airbnb. Apart from some oddly low rental prices of $15 and some as large as $4,000, most remained closely comparable to each other.  

The vast majority of reviewers stayed at one property. There is a small number that stayed at more than three properties.  

Most of the reviews are positive, although we donât these classified as positive or negative. However, the words used by guests to express their feelings regarding their stay were overwhelmingly positive.
